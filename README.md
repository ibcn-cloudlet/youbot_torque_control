Torque-Control
==============

This repository provides a torque controller for the KUKA youBot arm as well as a Service to generate trajectories which can then be executed by the torque controller. 

Based on [https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_youbot_torque_control](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_youbot_torque_control), but using our own [youbot_driver](https://github.com/ibcn-cloudlet/youbot_driver) and [youbot_driver_ros_interface](https://github.com/ibcn-cloudlet/youbot_driver_ros_interface) repositories.
